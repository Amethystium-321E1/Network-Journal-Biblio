TI PATTERNS IN THE RECALL OF PERSONS IN A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB This paper examines the cognitive structures people use to organize persons in memory. Members of a Christian fellowship of Taiwanese and Taiwanese-American young adults free-listed the names of fellowship members. Perceived social proximity was the primary and general associative factor in subjects recalls of fellowship members. Persons that were recalled successively were perceived to be much closer socially than would be expected by chance. Also, there were shorter pauses between adjacently recalled pairs of persons who were socially close than for those who were socially distant. Frequency (which persons tend to be recalled) and serial order (which persons tend to be mentioned earlier or later in recall) response patterns were influenced by persons visibility in the fellowship and perceived social proximity to a subject. The results suggest that members of a community share a common cognitive structure of community members that is based on the communitys social structure.

TI A SYNCHRONOUS DIGITAL SIGNAL-PROCESSING METHOD FOR DETECTING FACE-TO-FACE ORGANIZATIONAL COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB During the past decade, progress in research on human communication networks has been impeded by the discovery that self-reports of communication are not valid measures of independently observable behavior. Research on observable communication behavior has since languished because direct measurement of communication behavior by human observers is impractical. This report describes a method for using digital signal analysis of synchronous, independent-channel audio recordings to detect instances of message exchange behavior. The system achieved 95.1% agreement with a human observer in a laboratory test. Considerations for extension to the field are discussed.

TI No associative biases in the first name cued recall procedure for eliciting personal networks
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB One thousand five hundred twenty-five respondents from a representative sample of adult residents of the state of Florida (USA) participated in a telephone survey on personal networks (McCarty et al., 1995). McCarty et al. (1995) elicited samples of alters from respondents personal networks with a first name cued recall interview procedure. This paper reports an assessment of associative biases involved with this technique in a further evaluation of the representativeness of the alter samples elicited with this method. Associative biases would be present if successively recalled alters are more likely to know each other or belong to the same social context (e.g., work, family, school) than alters not recalled successively. Such biases, if present, could influence the characteristics, and thus the representativeness, of the set of alters elicited, such as the density of ties. Analyses indicate that there are no associative biases in the first name cued recall procedure. Future research should investigate the possibility of associative biases in other methods for eliciting personal networks. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI MEASURING A LARGE NETWORK QUICKLY
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB We describe work in which we used three days of interviewing to identify and measure the network among 200 people significant in a complex production process. The capture-recapture strategy should be useful in other settings: (1) Conduct survey network interviews with people (informants) positioned in the study population such that their contacts overlap to provide recaptured relations. (2) Estimate reliability from data consistency across recaptures. (3) Triangulate relation response categories to assign quantitative scores to the categories. (4) Use reliability correlates to weight recaptured relations in the final network pooled across interviews. (5) Extrapolate from the known strengths of the captured relations to define the uncaptured relations.

TI SOURCES OF SOCIAL-STRUCTURE IN A START-UP ORGANIZATION - WORK NETWORKS, WORK ACTIVITIES, AND JOB STATUS
SO SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB This paper explores possible salient dimensions of social structure in a start-up organizational setting. In particular, the relationship between judged similarity and three types of data representing structure in a small entrepreneurial medical technology firm is examined. Data concerning unconstrained judged similarity, work networks, work activities, and job status was collected within a month of the organizations initial start-up utilizing ethnographic, systematic and network methods of data collection. Data was analyzed using hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analysis to determine the structure of the organization according to each type of data collected. Measures of similarity were computed to determine the correspondence between the various organizational structures and the patterns of judged similarity of organizational actors. The multiplexity of the organizational structures was also assessed. Findings indicate that patterns of judged similarity correspond equally highly to each of the organizational structures, and that the structures are multiplex in only one case; work networks and work activities. Also, a high degree of consensus exists among the actors concerning their perceptions of organizational structure. Implications for research on social cognition, the process of innovation, and the growth of entrepreneurial organizations are discussed.
