We present two new effective ways to incorporate network structure into the one-compartmental ODE that approximates the dynamical evolution of the expected fraction of the population that participates in the revolution in the linear threshold ABM model. We show numerically that these ODE approximations often perform as well as or better than a higher-order model that has many compartments and is much more expensive computationally. Extending concepts from epidemiological modelling, we define a basic reproduction number R-0 for the linear threshold ABM and apply it to predict ABM behaviour on empirical networks. In small-scale numerical tests, we investigate experimentally the differences in spreading behaviour that occur under the linear threshold ABM model when applied to some empirical (modern) online social networks versus (traditional) offline social networks, searching for quantitative evidence that political revolutions may be facilitated by the modern online social networks of social media.', 'DYNAMICS; MEDIA']",10.1093/comnet/cnv030,"['Lang, JC (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON, Canada.']","['Ames GM, 2011, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V278, P3544, DOI 10.1098/rspb.2011.0290']"
